# Blog Frontend â€“ React + Vite

This is the **frontend** for my Blog API project, built with **JavaScript** and **ReactJS**.  
I've used **WebTUI** to give it a terminal-ish look.

## Live Demo

Try it out:  
https://majestic-croquembouche-a1c89c.netlify.app/

You can log in with the following test credentials:

- **Username**: `testuser`  
- **Password**: `password123`

Or feel free to register and create your own account.

## About the Project

This blog app allows users to:
- Write and publish blog posts using **Markdown**
- Edit or delete their own posts
- Sign up, log in, and stay authenticated using JWT tokens


The frontend is communicating with a blog API hosted separately.
If you would like to interact with the API directly visit:
